# Python-Inter-Assessment-VRV
This script analyzes a log file to find how often each IP address makes requests, which endpoints are accessed the most, and whether any IPs have suspicious activity like repeated failed logins. It uses regular expressions to extract IP addresses, endpoints, and status codes from each log entry. It counts the total requests for each IP, the number of times each endpoint is accessed, and tracks failed logins (e.g., error 401 or "Invalid credentials"). It identifies the most accessed endpoint and highlights IPs with too many failed login attempts. The results are shown in the console and saved to a CSV file, making it easy to review the activity and detect possible issues.
